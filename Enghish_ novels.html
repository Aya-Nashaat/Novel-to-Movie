                    The English novel is an important part of English literature. This article mainly concerns novels, written in English, by novelists who were born or have spent a significant part of their lives in England, or Scotland, or Wales, or Northern Ireland (or Ireland before 1922). However, given the nature of the subject, this guideline has been applied with common sense, and reference is made to novels in other languages or novelists who are not primarily British where appropriate.

                        <h3>The History of novels</h3>
                        <p> A novel is a relatively long work of narrative fiction, normally written in prose form, and which is typically published as a book.

                             The entire genre has been seen as having "a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years",[1] with its origins in classical Greece and Rome, in medieval and early modern romance, and in the tradition of the Italian renaissance novella. (Since the 18th century, the term "novella", or "novelle" in German, has been used in English and other European languages to describe a long short story or a short novel.)

                                 Christie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in Torquay, Devon. Before marrying and starting a family in London, she had served in a Devon hospital during the First World War, tending to troops coming back from the trenches. She was initially an unsuccessful writer with six consecutive rejections,[4] but this changed when The Mysterious Affair at Styles, featuring Hercule Poirot, was published in 1920.[5] During the Second World War, she worked as a pharmacy assistant at University College Hospital, London, acquiring a good knowledge of poisons which feature in many of her novels.

                        <p>Born in Portsmouth, Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors' prison.
